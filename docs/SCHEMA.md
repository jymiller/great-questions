# Schema for AI Exploration

## Introduction

This framework captures key questions of artificial intelligence (AI) and its societal implications by intertwining philosophical inquiry with the Socratic method, to foster a nuanced dialogue around AI technologies, policies, and ethics.

## Framework Components

- **Questions (Q)**: Fundamental inquiries driving the exploration of AI and its impact.
- **Thinking (T)**: The critical, ethical, and philosophical thinking essential for addressing AI-related questions and forming reasoned positions.
- **Positions (P)**: Diverse viewpoints held by individuals or groups in response to AI questions.
- **Individuals (I)**: The people engaging in the discourse, contributing their perspectives, arguments, and counterarguments.  
- **Evidence (E)**: The data, studies, and real-world examples supporting or challenging various positions.

Together we call this: QT-PIE (Questions, Thinking, Positions, Individuals, Evidence)

## Implementing "QT-PIE"

The ramework is implemented within our knowledge graph, enabling users to navigate the complex landscape of AI through a structured yet flexible approach. By highlighting Questions as the starting point, and interweaving Thinking, Positions, Individuals, and Evidence, QT-PIE facilitates a comprehensive understanding of AI's multifaceted issues.

## Dynamic Relationships in QT-PIE

In the QT-PIE framework, the power of exploration lies not just in the entities themselves — Questions, Thinking, Positions, Individuals, Evidence — but in the dynamic relationships that connect them. These relationships form the backbone of our knowledge graph, enabling a rich, interconnected dialogue around AI. Here’s how they bring the QT-PIE framework to life:

- **Raises**: At the heart of every inquiry are the curious minds that raise questions. This relationship ties Individuals directly to the Questions they pose, spotlighting the human curiosity driving the exploration of AI.

- **Explores**: The journey from question to understanding is paved with Thinking. Each Question is explored through rigorous, philosophical thinking, reflecting our commitment to deep, meaningful inquiry.

- **Holds**: Positions are personal; they reflect the stances Individuals or Groups take on AI's pressing questions. This relationship maps the diverse viewpoints populating the discourse, emphasizing the plurality of thought within our community.

- **Supports**: No position stands alone; it is buttressed by Evidence. This crucial relationship links Positions to the data, studies, and examples that underpin them, grounding our discussions in reality.

- **Challenges**: Debate is the crucible in which knowledge is refined. Positions and Evidence challenge and are challenged in turn, embodying the dialectical process that drives our collective understanding forward.

- **Inspires**: One question leads to another, and Thinking on one issue often inspires further Questions. This relationship captures the iterative nature of inquiry, where each answer opens new avenues of exploration.

Through these relationships, we model not just a static collection of ideas, but an evolving conversation.
 It’s here, in the interplay of Questions, Thinking, Positions, Individuals, and Evidence, that we find the true essence of our inquiry into AI — a dialogue that’s as dynamic and multifaceted as the field itself.

## A Vision for AI and Human Interaction

The reaction to the change that will come with AI is creating anxiety in our already complicated world. We aspire to make the interaction between AI and humanity more friendly.  And believe that by we can demystify AI, encouraging more people to participate in critical discussions about our joint future.  We aim to build a community where curiosity, critical thinking, and compassion allow for a better future.
