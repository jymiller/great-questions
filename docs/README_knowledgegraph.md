# AI Viewpoints Knowledge Graph Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a knowledge graph that maps out various positions, questions, and categories related to artificial intelligence (AI). By leveraging Python, specifically libraries such as NetworkX for graph construction and manipulation, PyVis for graph visualization, and Streamlit for interactive web application development, this project seeks to organize and visualize the complex landscape of AI viewpoints.

The ultimate goal is to create an interactive tool that enables users to explore different perspectives on AI, identify common questions, and compare positions across a wide range of entities including individuals, groups, and institutions.

## Objectives

- **Knowledge Graph Construction**: Utilize Python and the NetworkX library to build a knowledge graph that represents entities (people, groups) and their relationships with AI topics.
- **Visualization**: Integrate PyVis to enable dynamic visualization of the knowledge graph, making the relationships and entities easy to navigate and understand.
- **Interactive Application**: Develop a Streamlit web application that allows users to interact with the knowledge graph, explore different viewpoints, and extract insights through an intuitive interface.
- **Data Categorization**: Implement a structured approach to categorize questions and positions related to AI, using frameworks inspired by library science (e.g., PICO, POLL) to ensure a comprehensive representation of the AI landscape.
- **Comparison and Analysis**: Provide functionality within the application to compare and analyze different viewpoints, highlighting consensus areas as well as points of contention.

## Project Setup and Design

- Define the project's scope and select the appropriate tools and libraries.
- Design a schema that outlines the entities and relationships within the knowledge graph.

## Development and Deployment

- Set up the development environment and start building the knowledge graph.
- Integrate visualization tools and develop the Streamlit application.
- Test the application for functionality, usability, and performance.
- Deploy the application for public access.

## Maintenance and Expansion

- Monitor the application's performance and user feedback.
- Continuously update the data and refine features based on user insights.
- Explore opportunities to expand the dataset and enhance application features.

## Documentation

- Provide thorough documentation of the code and development process.
- Create a user guide for navigating and utilizing the application effectively.

This project represents a step towards understanding the diverse and complex views on AI, facilitating informed discussions and research in the field. Contributions, feedback, and suggestions are welcome as we work towards making this tool a valuable resource for the AI community.


 ## Schema Design

Our project's schema design is documented in detail within the [SCHEMA.md](docs/SCHEMA.md) file. For a structured schema definition, see [schema_definition.yaml](schema/schema_definition.yaml).
