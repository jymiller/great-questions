Title,Body
Define Project Scope,"Outline the main goals, features, and limitations of the knowledge graph project."
Research and Select Tools,"Decide on the Python libraries (e.g., NetworkX, PyVis) and any other tools (e.g., Streamlit) to be used."
Schema Design for Knowledge Graph,"Define the entities (nodes) and relationships (edges) that the knowledge graph will include. This schema will serve as a blueprint for graph construction."
Select or Design Question Framework,"Choose or design a question framework to structure the information within the knowledge graph. Consider frameworks like PICO or POLL as inspiration."
Set Up Development Environment,"Prepare the development environment with the necessary libraries and tools installed. This may include setting up virtual environments, installing dependencies, and ensuring compatibility."
Implement Basic Knowledge Graph Structure,"Start coding the basic structure of the knowledge graph using NetworkX. This involves initializing the graph and defining a simple mechanism for adding nodes and edges."
Data Modeling According to Schema,"Implement the previously designed schema in code, creating functions to add nodes and edges according to the defined entities and relationships."
Develop Data Input Mechanism,"Develop a method for manually or automatically inputting data into the graph. Consider the use of forms, scripts, or APIs for data ingestion."
Integrate Graph Visualization Tool,"Integrate PyVis for graph visualization. Ensure the visualization is compatible with the graph structure and can be embedded in Streamlit."
Develop Initial Streamlit Application,"Begin coding the Streamlit application. Focus on basic functionalities like displaying the graph and allowing basic user interactions."
